          <h1>Earthquakes</h1>
          <p>An earthquake is a natural phenomenon caused when underground rock suddenly breaks and there is a rapid movement along the faults within the Earth. 
            This action releases the inbuilt 'elastic strain' energy which travels through the Earth in the form of seismic waves,
             and causes an intense shaking of the earth's outer surface.<br><b>How do most of the earthquakes occur</b>
             <br>Earthquakes occur anywhere on the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture 
             propagation along a fault plane. The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and
              aseismically only if there are no irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increases the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities, which leads to a form of stick-slip behavior. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and, therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the stored energy.
              This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic strain seismic waves, frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure is referred to as the elastic-rebound theory. It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake fracture growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available elastic potential energy and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the Earth's deep interior.

             <ul>
             <b>Before an earthquake:</b>
              
               
              <li>Know your emergency evacuation routes and exits.</li>
              <li>Secure heavy furniture and objects to walls.</li>
              <li>Store flammable liquids and gases outside.</li>
              <li>Have a fire extinguisher and know how to use it.</li>
              <li>Practice earthquake drills with your family.</li>
              
              <b>During an earthquake:</b>
              <br>
              
              <li>Drop to the ground and take cover under a steady piece of furniture.</li> 
              <li>Hold onto a firm furniture to prevent being knocked over.<br></li>
              <li>Stay away from windows, mirrors, and glass doors.<br></li>
              <li>Stay indoors until the tremors stops.<br></li>
              <li>Do not run or stand in outdoors.<br></li> 
              <li>Don't panic<br></li>
              
              <b>After an earthquake:</b>
              
              <li>Inspect for injuries </li> 
              <li> Inspect for gas and water leaks.</li>
              <li> Scrutinize for structural damage to your home.</li>
          
              <li>Relocate/vacate from a place if instructed to do so ,by authorities.
              </li> 
              Bonus!!:
              
              <li>Keep yourself abreast about earthquake risks and hotspots in your area.</li>
              <li> Have a disaster supply kit which consists of all the basic necessities like food, water, and first aid supplies.</li>
             <li> Consider installing earthquake-resistant fasteners on heavy furniture and objects.</li>
             <li>Stay calm,composed and follow evacuation instructions from the authorities.</li>
