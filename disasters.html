          <h1>Earthquakes</h1>
          <p>An earthquake is a natural phenomenon caused when underground rock suddenly breaks and there is a rapid movement along the faults within the Earth. 
            This action releases the inbuilt 'elastic strain' energy which travels through the Earth in the form of seismic waves,
             and causes an intense shaking of the earth's outer surface.<br><b>How earthquakes occur?</b>
             <br>Earthquakes occur anywhere on the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture 
             propagation along a fault plane. The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and
              aseismically only if there are no irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increases the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities, which leads to a form of stick-slip behavior. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and, therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the stored energy.
              This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic strain seismic waves, frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure is referred to as the elastic-rebound theory. It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake fracture growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available elastic potential energy and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the Earth's deep interior.

          <h1>Floods</h1>
          
          <p>A flood is an overflow of water that 
            submerges land and can cause damage to properties, infrastructure, and the environment. 
             It occurs when the water level in a river, lake, or ocean exceeds its normal limits,
             often due to heavy rainfall, storm surges, or snowmelt.<br><b>How do floods occur?</b>
              <br>Floods can occur due to various reasons, and are classified into five categories:flash floods, coastal floods, river (fluvial) floods, ponding (pluvial) floods, and urban floods.
              Flash floods are fast-moving unexpected floods that occur when there is a surge in flowing water levels such as those caused due to sudden heavy rainfall or an outburst from a glacial lake. Coastal floods occur when sea levels rise due to heavy storms combined with high tides; this forces seawater onto the normally dry inland areas adjoining the coast. River or fluvial floods usually occur when rivers, swollen with prolonged or extensive rainfall, breach their river banks and flood surrounding areas. Ponding or pluvial flooding happens in flat areas when prolonged rain overwhelms the drainage (via river/canal flows) and absorbing (via groundwater/lake systems) capacities of the lands.
              
              Urban floods are special cases of flooding that are caused when a city's sewage and canal systems cannot adequately handle a large influx of water due to flash/coastal/riverine flooding or heavy rainfall. In most cases, urban flooding is attributable to poorly planned/maintained drainage systems in cities and encroachments in low-lying areas such as lake beds.

        <div id="Tsunamis">
          <h1>Tsunamis</h1>
          <p>A tsunami is a series of ocean waves caused by the displacement of a large volume of water, 
            usually as a result of an earthquake or volcanic eruption, landslide, or meteorite impact. 
            These waves have extremely long wavelengths and periods, traveling at speeds of up to 500 miles
             per hour and reaching heights of over 30 meters above sea level. Tsunamis can cause widespread 
             destruction and loss of life when they reach coastal areas, resulting in flooding, damage, 
             displacement, and fatalities. Early warning systems and evacuation plans are crucial for 
             mitigating the impact of tsunamis,
             which can be triggered by various events and have devastating effects on coastal communities.

               various phenomenon,namely

               Earthquakes ,seafloor tremors that displace water above, triggering a tsunami wave,
               
               Volcanic eruptions,explosive eruptions that displace water in the ocean or a lake,
               
               Landslides, submarine or coastal landslides that push water out of the way, generating a tsunami,
               
               Meteorite impacts, potentially catastrophic, impacts that displace massive amounts of water,
               
               Human activities: In a rare consequence, tsunamis can be triggered by human actions, such as mining or construction, that alter the seafloor or coastline,and
               
               These events displace water, creating a series of ocean waves that can travel at speeds of up to 500 miles per hour, reaching heights of over 
               30 meters (100 feet) and causing widespread destruction when they reach coastal areas.

          <p>A landslide is the movement of rock, debris, or earth down a slope, often caused by a combination of natural and human factors. Landslides can be sudden or gradual, and they can occur on land or underwater.

           <br> The  different types of landslides are
            
           Rockfall which occur due to sudden release of rocks from a cliff face,
             Debris flows, which occur by fast-moving mixtures of water, soil, and debris,
           mudslides,which occur due to movement of mud and debris down a slope,
             landslips,occur due to timid movement of soil or rock down a slope, and
            lubsidence, Sinking or settling of the ground surface.
            

             <br><b>How do landslides occur?</b>
              <br>The tremendous movement is be caused by a combination of factors, including heavy rainfall or 
              flooding, earthquakes or tremors, volcanic activity, human activities such as deforestation or 
              construction, soil erosion or weathering, groundwater changes, and climate change. 
              Landslides can take various forms, including rockfalls, debris flows, mudslides, landslips, 
              and subsidence, each with its own unique characteristics and potential impacts. 
              The effects of landslides can be devastating, resulting in property damage or
